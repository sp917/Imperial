\section{Derivation of model according to Danilov et al 2016}

A fluid is moving inside a domain $\M(t)$, which is divided into $N$ discrete regions V_{k}(t) which evolve with time:
\eqnn{
	\M(t) = \bigcup_{k=1}^{N} V_{k}(t)
} 
Each region $V_{k}$ consists of a vertically-oriented triangular prism, for which the top and bottom triangle may change in time in both height and orientation. \\
Consider the fluid contained within one of these regions. The fluid obeys Newton's second law
\eqnn{
	\D{}{t} \int_{V_{k}(t)}
}
